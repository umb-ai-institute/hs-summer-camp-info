        <h4>Professor Ping Chen's Project: AI For Nature: Building a Wildlife Image Classifier</h4>
        <p>In this 3-week summer camp project, students will explore how artificial intelligence can help protect wildlife through image classification. 
            Participants will learn the basics of machine learning and computer vision by building a simple AI model that can identify different species 
            of animals from photos taken in nature reserves or camera traps. The project starts with an introduction to Python and AI fundamentals, 
            including data labeling, neural networks, and model training. Students will work in teams to collect and clean datasets, train image 
            classifiers using platforms like  TensorFlow, and evaluate model performance. They will also explore real-world applications of AI in 
            conservation and reflect on ethical considerations, such as bias in data and the importance of preserving biodiversity. By the end of the camp,
             students will present their models and findings in a final showcase, demonstrating how AI can be used for positive environmental impact. No prior 
             coding experience is required—just curiosity and a willingness to learn.</p>
        <h4>Expected Student Outcomes:</h4>
        <p><li>Gain hands-on experience in machine learning and image classification using real-world tools.</li>
        <li>Understand the role of AI in environmental conservation and ethical implications of technology.</li>

            awards. His research has been funded by both NIH and NSF.</p>
        <h4>Professor Xiaohui Liang's Project: AI Agents for Usable and Accurate Dietary Assessment (UADA) </h4>
        <p>Are you interested in AI, mobile apps, and making a real impact on older adults' health? Join our exciting 3-week summer camp 
            project to help build the next-generation UADA app—a smart dietary assessment tool that combines Voice AI and Visual AI to help 
            seniors easily track what they eat. Traditional tools like the ASA-24 are long, complicated, and not friendly to older users. 
            Our UADA app is different: it uses natural voice conversations powered by large language models and realistic food visuals 
            generated by cutting-edge AI to make food tracking simple, accurate, and even fun. You’ll get hands-on experience with automatic 
            speech recognition (ASR), LLM customization (like OpenAI’s GPT or Whisper), and image generation models, all while contributing to 
            a meaningful healthcare project. You’ll also learn how AI can be applied to solve real-world problems in geriatric health and 
            human-centered design. Whether you’re into coding, AI, UX/UI design, or just want to explore healthcare technology, this project 
            welcomes students of all backgrounds.</p>
        <h4>Expected Student Outcomes:</h4>
        <p><li>Hands-on Experience with Cutting-Edge AI Tools: Students will gain practical skills in applying Voice AI (automatic speech recognition, large language models) and Visual AI (text-to-image generation) in real-world applications.</li>
            <li>Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Problem-Solving: Through teamwork and mentorship, students will tackle real challenges in health tech, combining computer science, human-centered design, and geriatric care.</li>
            <li>Portfolio-Ready Project with Social Impact: By the end of the camp, students will have contributed to a working prototype of the UADA app—a project that can be showcased in their resumes, portfolios, or college applications.</li></p>

        <h4>Professor Shichao Pei's Bio:</h4>
        <p>Dr. Shichao Pei is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Massachusetts Boston. 
            His research interests include machine learning, large language models, trustworthy AI systems. His work has been published 
            in top-tier conferences and journals.</p>
        <h4>Professor Shichao Pei's Project: Smart Connections: Building a Friend Recommendation AI</h4>
        <p>Have you ever wondered how apps like Snapchat or Instagram suggest people you might know? In this 3-week summer camp project, you’ll 
            build your own mini version of that system—powered by AI. By modeling friendships as a network of connections, you’ll train an AI to 
            spot hidden patterns and recommend new friends, just like real-world social platforms do. You’ll begin with a beginner-friendly introduction
             to Python and AI concepts, including how to work with networks, analyze connections, and build simple predictive models. Then, using real-world 
             data, you’ll design and train your own AI-powered friend recommender. Along the way, you’ll explore powerful tools like NetworkX for network 
             analysis and scikit-learn for model training. Beyond coding, this project also invites you to think critically: What happens when AI influences 
             who we talk to online? Can friend suggestions reinforce echo chambers? You’ll learn not only how these systems work, but also how to build them 
             responsibly. At the end of the camp, you’ll present your personalized system and share what you’ve learned about the intersection of technology, 
             society, and human connection.</p>
        <h4>Expected Student Outcomes:</h4>
        <p><li>Learn how to represent social networks as data and understand how AI can analyze connections to make predictions.</li>
            <li>Build their own friend recommendation system and evaluate how well it works.</li>
            <li>Explain both the technical process and the social impact of AI-driven recommendations.</li></p>
