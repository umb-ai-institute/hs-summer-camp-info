            <h3>Professor Ping Chen, Professor of Computer Engineering and Director of AI Lab at UMass Boston</h3>
            <h4>Professor Chen's Bio:</h4>
            <p>Dr. Ping Chen is a Full Professor of Computer Engineering and the Director of Artificial Intelligence Lab at the University of
                Massachusetts Boston. His research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. 
                Dr. Chen has published over 100 papers in major Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning conferences and journals.</p>
            <h4>Professor Chen's Project: AI For Nature: Building a Wildlife Image Classifier</h4>
            <p>In this 3-week summer camp project, students will explore how artificial intelligence can help protect wildlife through image classification. 
                Participants will learn the basics of machine learning and computer vision by building a simple AI model that can identify different species 
                of animals from photos taken in nature reserves or camera traps. The project starts with an introduction to Python and AI fundamentals, 
                including data labeling, neural networks, and model training. Students will work in teams to collect and clean datasets, train image 
                classifiers using platforms like  TensorFlow, and evaluate model performance. They will also explore real-world applications of AI in 
                conservation and reflect on ethical considerations, such as bias in data and the importance of preserving biodiversity. By the end of the camp,
                students will present their models and findings in a final showcase, demonstrating how AI can be used for positive environmental impact. No prior 
                coding experience is requiredâ€”just curiosity and a willingness to learn.</p>
            <h4>Expected Student Outcomes:</h4>
            <p><li>Gain hands-on experience in machine learning and image classification using real-world tools.</li>
            <li>Understand the role of AI in environmental conservation and ethical implications of technology.</li>
            <li>Develop teamwork, problem-solving, and presentation skills through a collaborative final showcase.</li></p>

                awards. His research has been funded by both NIH and NSF.</p>
            <h4>Professor Liang's Project: AI Agents for Usable and Accurate Dietary Assessment (UADA) </h4>
            <p>Are you interested in AI, mobile apps, and making a real impact on older adults' health? Join our exciting 3-week summer camp 
                project to help build the next-generation UADA appâ€”a smart dietary assessment tool that combines Voice AI and Visual AI to help 
                seniors easily track what they eat. Traditional tools like the ASA-24 are long, complicated, and not friendly to older users. 
                Our UADA app is different: it uses natural voice conversations powered by large language models and realistic food visuals 
                generated by cutting-edge AI to make food tracking simple, accurate, and even fun. Youâ€™ll get hands-on experience with automatic 
                speech recognition (ASR), LLM customization (like OpenAIâ€™s GPT or Whisper), and image generation models, all while contributing to 
                a meaningful healthcare project. Youâ€™ll also learn how AI can be applied to solve real-world problems in geriatric health and 
                human-centered design. Whether youâ€™re into coding, AI, UX/UI design, or just want to explore healthcare technology, this project 
                welcomes students of all backgrounds.</p>
            <h4>Expected Student Outcomes:</h4>
            <p><li>Hands-on Experience with Cutting-Edge AI Tools: Students will gain practical skills in applying Voice AI (automatic speech recognition, large language models) and Visual AI (text-to-image generation) in real-world applications.</li>
                <li>Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Problem-Solving: Through teamwork and mentorship, students will tackle real challenges in health tech, combining computer science, human-centered design, and geriatric care.</li>
                <li>Portfolio-Ready Project with Social Impact: By the end of the camp, students will have contributed to a working prototype of the UADA appâ€”a project that can be showcased in their resumes, portfolios, or college applications.</li></p>

            <h3>Professor Shichao Pei, Assistant Professor, Computer Science</h3>
            <h4>Professor Pei's Bio:</h4>
            <p>Dr. Shichao Pei is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Massachusetts Boston. 
                His research interests include machine learning, large language models, trustworthy AI systems. His work has been published 
                in top-tier conferences and journals.</p>
            <h4>Professor Pei's Project: Smart Connections: Building a Friend Recommendation AI</h4>
            <p>Have you ever wondered how apps like Snapchat or Instagram suggest people you might know? In this 3-week summer camp project, youâ€™ll 
                build your own mini version of that systemâ€”powered by AI. By modeling friendships as a network of connections, youâ€™ll train an AI to 
                spot hidden patterns and recommend new friends, just like real-world social platforms do. Youâ€™ll begin with a beginner-friendly introduction
                to Python and AI concepts, including how to work with networks, analyze connections, and build simple predictive models. Then, using real-world 
                data, youâ€™ll design and train your own AI-powered friend recommender. Along the way, youâ€™ll explore powerful tools like NetworkX for network 
                analysis and scikit-learn for model training. Beyond coding, this project also invites you to think critically: What happens when AI influences 
                who we talk to online? Can friend suggestions reinforce echo chambers? Youâ€™ll learn not only how these systems work, but also how to build them 
                responsibly. At the end of the camp, youâ€™ll present your personalized system and share what youâ€™ve learned about the intersection of technology, 
                society, and human connection.</p>
            <h4>Expected Student Outcomes:</h4>
            <p><li>Learn how to represent social networks as data and understand how AI can analyze connections to make predictions.</li>
                <li>Build their own friend recommendation system and evaluate how well it works.</li>
                <li>Explain both the technical process and the social impact of AI-driven recommendations.</li></p>

                Google's Gemini through their APIs, while also implementing support for locally-run open-source models like Llama. Through this 
                project, students will gain practical experience in API integration, software architecture, user interface design, and the deployment 
                of AI systems, while developing a deeper understanding of how different AI models compare in capabilities and use cases. By the end of 
                the project, students will built a functional AI gateway that demonstrates real-world software engineering skills and showcases their 
                ability to work with cutting-edge AI technologies.</p>
            <h4>Expected Student Outcomes:</h4>
            <p><li>Technical Proficiency in AI Integration: Students will successfully integrate multiple AI models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and local models) into a unified gateway system with proper API management and error handling.</li>
                <li>Research Skills Development: Students will learn to evaluate and compare different AI models through systematic testing, analyze performance metrics, and document their findings using scientific methodology.</li>
                <li>Professional Development: Participants will gain experience in project planning, version control, technical documentation, and presenting complex technical work to diverse audiences.</li></p>
